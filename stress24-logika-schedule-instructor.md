This file contains instructor notes for the STRESS 2024 lectures on Logika

# Schedule

## M1 (John)

Slang Overview (10 mins) 
  * Slang purpose and design goals
  * Slang use (implemenenting Sireum, HAMR context)
  * Slang language features (example based)
  * Pointers to more information

Logika Overview (10 mins - 20 mins total)
  * Logika purpose and design goals
  * Logika use (Slang stand alone, HAMR context)
  * Logika GUI illustration
  * Logika scalability
  * Contract example (just viewing)
  * Deduce examples (just viewing)
  * Advanced manual proof with rewriting examples (just viewing)
  * Teaching material

Logika UI Principles -- Interactive (15 mins - 35 minutes total) 
  * idea: 
    - students click around on bolts and bulbs in various examples, they seed various errors and show them being detected, etc.
    - this could be based on the Waypoint Example.  Note, if this is converted to Presentasi, then it could be broken into three sections 

Logika Checking for Conditional Statements (15 mins - 50 minutes total) 


Logika Checking for Compositional Reasoning (15 mins - 1:05 minutes total) 
  * idea:
    - students are given partial program and the goal is to add method implementation, method clients, and contracts to illustrate compositional reasoning
    - guided exercise 

Features Overview 
  - datatypes / records
  - ???
  - point them to folder of examples

Extended exercise 
  * idea:
    - students are given a description of code and specifications to write, potentially along with some starting content
    - possible example: 
      - parts of Stefan's fibonacci example
      - max3 directly, and max3 in terms of max2
    - slang/logika features
      - conditionals
      - contracts
      - method calls
    - pitfalls: need to make sure that students have enough documentation.
  * **What example should be used for this?**



## M2 (Stefan)

Solution walkthrough of exercise given before break (5 mins) (John)

Logika Checking for Loops, Loop Invariants -- Interactive -- Stefan (15 mins)
  * idea: 
    - students are presented with loops for integer calculations (summing, factorial)


Logika Checking for Sequences, Quantification -- Interactive -- Stefan (15 mins)
  * idea: 
    - students are presented with examples of sequences, quantification, index bounds checking, etc.
    - consider example to find max or min element in a sequence (as needed for insertion sort)


Extended exercise - Stefan (25 mins)
  * idea:
    - students are given a description of code and specifications to write, potentially along with some starting content
    - if we give the students the code for selection sort (as built up in previous activties, they could be asked to do bubble sort)
    - slang/logika features
      - loops, sequences, quantification
  * **What example should be used for this?**


Possible progression
  - findMin - sequences, quantification
  - swap - mutable 
  - selection sort 
  ==>
  - bubble sort


## A1

Manual Proofs / Rewriting Overview -- John or Stefan
  * idea:
    - students are given completed examples of rewriting, etc.
    - slang/logika features
      - rewriting, rules
  * **What example should be used for this?**

???


Extended exercise

Other Verificaton Concepts Supported in Logika (?? where exactly would this go ??)
  - in the logika example of conformance-swap, there is a proof of equivalence between swapping by arithemetic and swapping by updates

## A2 

HAMR / GUMBO Overview -- John

Extended exercise (based on Isolette)
