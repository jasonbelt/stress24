# stress24 - Student Schedule and Guidelines


## Preliminaries

### Install and Confirm Installation with Examples

Make sure that have installed Sireum -- download and installation instructions can be found here XXXXXX

Confirm that your installation is set up correctly

* (Navigate to the Sireum IVE application and launch)

(What about Proyek ? )

* Open the example workspace
  - Chose the File / Open option
  - Navigate to and select the workspace folder `stress24-examples-ive`, then press the Open button

* In the workspace folder, open (double-click) on the file XXXX `00-open-me-first.sc` XXXX 
  - You can see the Logika program verifier working when purple annotations (light bulbs and lightning bolts) appear in the margin
  - To execute the contents of the file, press the green button in the top-left margin of the file.   This should cause a console window to open at the bottom of the screen and output from the program will be displayed there.

## Morning Session #1 (M1): 1.5 hours

This session will introduce you to the Slang programming language (safety-critical subset of Scala) and the Logika program verifier for Slang.  You will learn basic aspects of the Sireum Integrated Verification Environment (IVE) interface and aspects of the Slang programming language -- building up to some simple exercises using conditional expressions and method calls.

**Overview of Slang** 
  * Slides (XXX insert link XXX)

**Overview of Logika** 
  * Slides (XXX insert link XXX)

**Walkthrough of Slang/Logika features using the Waypoint example**  

This lecture module (a) introduces you the Slang language features (b)
illustrates the basic aspects of interacting with Logika verification.

* Follow along in the Slang scripts in the `waypoint-scripts`
  folder.  As the lecture progresses, 
    * open each file, 
    * guided by the lecturer, click on the various Logika annotations to see the
      verification information produced by Logika,
    * guided by the lecturer, make simple modifications to the scripts (e.g., insert bugs)
      to see how Logika detects problems.

**Exercises**

In comments in each file, simple exercises are suggested for you on
your own.

**Logika Verification of Conditional Expressions**

This lecture module explores the basic principles for reasoning about
*conditional statements*.  We starting by doing a walkthrough of
Logika applied to existing code.  Then you are given some exercises
for you to do on your own.

  * Slides (XXX insert link XXX)
  * Examples (XXX insert link XXX)

**Exercises**

We will take a small break in the lecture to allow you to do the
following exercises.


**Logika Verification of Method Contracts**

  * Slides
  * Examples
